I worked on infrastructure modernization and process improvements, focusing on system stability and user comfort. Honestly, I don’t yet have commercial DevOps experience; I’m actively learning and building my own project (Git, Docker, basic CI/CD pipelines). My strengths are quickly picking up new tools, communication, documentation, and a constant drive to learn. I’m open to remote roles — not only DevOps but also administration/systems and related areas. I’m looking for a place where I can bring value from day one while growing my cloud and automation skills.",
